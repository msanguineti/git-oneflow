> CLI tools implementing the _OneFlow_ git branching model.

OneFlow is a git branching model proposed by [Adam Ruka](https://github.com/skinny85) as an [alternative to GitFlow](https://www.endoflineblog.com/gitflow-considered-harmful).

In [this article](https://www.endoflineblog.com/oneflow-a-git-branching-model-and-workflow#develop-feature-branches), Adam describes how it works and when it should be employed.

**_This workflow is not for the uninitiated:_**

1. Heavy use of `rebase`
2. By default, work is off of `master`
3. ???
4. No Profit :( and surefire way to mess things up quickly and embarrassingly.

For a good overview of why you should _and_ when you shouldn't use rebase read [this](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing#_rebase_peril)

I have simply put together some CLI commands to leverage the OneFlow model.

I have remained strictly faithful to how Adam defines the worlflow without adding anything fancy (yet). This means that, by default, **_git-OneFlow_** works with one main branch only (`master`) and new features are rebased. Check the [initialisation](#initialisation) section.

Of course, one-size-fits-all does not always work, therefore, I have implemented all the feature integration options described in the article and both the _one main branch_ and _main and development branches_ models.

Fun facts:

1. _Two branches_ model + integration option #2 gives... :drumroll: GitFlow :)
2. Adam Ruka doesn't really like the idea of 'tools' like this one

## Install

```sh
npm install -g git-oneflow
```

## Usage

```sh
git-oneflow --help
```

or

```sh
gof --help
```

`gof` is a convenient alias for the overly verbose and long to type `git-oneflow`.

## Configuration

**_git-OneFlow_** comes with some defaults which faithfully mirror Adam Ruka recommendations.

### Defaults

#### One main branch

`master`

#### Feature branches

Feature branches stem from `feature`:

```sh
gof feature start my-feature
# equivalent to...
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
```

Finishing a feature is done by rebasing:

```sh
gof feature finish my-feature
# equivalent to...
git checkout feature/my-feature
git rebase -i master
git checkout master
git merge --ff-only feature/my-feature
git push origin master
git branch -d feature/my-feature
```

The rebase step might be set to perform always, never or ask the user everytime. Also, passing the option `--overwrite-interactive` will make the step perform no matter the option set (see [Options](#options))

#### Release/Hotfix branches

Releases and hotfixes share the same workflow: (just substitute `hotfix` for `release` in the following examples)

```sh
gof release start 2.3.0
# equivalent to...
git checkout -b release/2.3.0
```

...then

```sh
gof release finish 2.3.0
# equivalent to...
git checkout release/2.3.0
git tag 2.3.0
git checkout master
git merge release/2.3.0
git push --tags origin master
git branch -d release/2.3.0
```

Using the above commands, release (and hotfix) branches will stem from the current branch. Hopefully this is `master`, but even so, this might not be desirable. Therefore, the `start` command takes an extra optional parameter which defines where the release (or hotfix) should stem from.

```sh
gof release start 2.3.0 09f76a3
# equivalent to...
git checkout -b release/2.3.0 09f76a3
```

The above command will start a release from commit `09f76a3`.

##### Tags

Automatic tagging creation when releasing or hotfixing might not be needed. One case would be if something like `standard version` is used, which tags releases based on some commit conventions. Therefore, there's a configuration option named `tags` which is `true` by default. Setting it to `false` will not create tags and also tags won't be pushed.

```sh
# do work, commit, test, build, ...
npm run release
# standard version does its magic
# some tag is created
gof release finish my-release
# equivalent to...
git checkout master
git merge release/my-release
git push origin master
git branch -d release/my-release
# now push --follow-tags origin && npm publish
```

_It is up to the user to manage tagging._

### Customisation

```sh
gof init
```

`init` starts an interactive session that allows for customising the configuration of **_git-OneFlow_**

This creates a `gof.config.js` file with the chosen configuration options.

#### Configuration files

By default, **_git-OneFlow_** checks for a config file (`gof.config.js`, `.gofrc` or `.gofrc.js`), or a dedicated `git-oneflow` section in `package.json`

```js
// package.json
{
  "git-oneflow": {
    "feature": "feat",
    "delete": "ask"
  }
}
```

Passing `--config <fileName>` allows to specify the config file to use.

> The `package.json` section takes precedence over any file.

| `interactive` | whether to rebase interactively `rebase -i` (default `always`, can also be `never` or `ask`)                                      |
| `push`        | whether to push to `origin` after finishing (default `always`, can also be `never` or `ask`)                                      |

When an option is set to `ask`, the user will be prompted to choose an action when appropriate.

`gof.config.js` with default values:

```js
module.exports = {
  main: 'master',
  usedev: false,
  feature: 'feature',
  release: 'release',
  hotfix: 'hotfix',
  integration: 1,
  interactive: 'always',
  push: 'always',
  delete: 'always',
  tags: true
